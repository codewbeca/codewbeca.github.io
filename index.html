                <h2>I'm Rebeca, a Web Developer and CS student.</h2>
                <p>
                     I build clean, creative, and user-focused websites with purpose. Whether its bringing a design to life with code or solving problems with smart functionality, I love turning ideas into digital realities.
                     Currently expanding my skills in full-stack development and modern frameworks, while working on passion projects that blend creativity with tech.

                  <h4>Pomodoro Timer</h4>
                  
                    A calming and minimal Pomodoro Timer to help you stay focused while studying or coding. 
                    I designed it to blend beautifully into your workspace, without the stress of traditional timers.

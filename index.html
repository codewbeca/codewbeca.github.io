                <h2>I'm Rebeca, a Web Developer and CS student.</h2>
                <p>
                     I build clean, creative, and user-focused websites with purpose. Whether its bringing a design to life with code or solving problems with smart functionality, I love turning ideas into digital realities.
                     Currently expanding my skills in full-stack development and modern frameworks, while working on passion projects that blend creativity with tech.

                <h3>Side Project Spotlight</h3>
                <p>
                  When I'm not coding websites, I'm designing inspirational web dev merch that brings a little joy and motivation to your workspace. From pastel coding mugs to aesthetic tech totes to laptop sleeves with matching phone cases and scented candles for your workspace, I'm sure you'll find something you'll love!

                  <h4>Pomodoro Timer</h4>
                    <p>
                    A calming and minimal Pomodoro Timer to help you stay focused while studying or coding. 
                    I designed it to blend beautifully into your workspace, with Study Mode, Break Mode, and a Custom Timer Input.

                    Inspired by the need to quickly jot down ideas and tasks, this Stickies App keeps your notes in sight while you work with its Always-On-Top special feature.
